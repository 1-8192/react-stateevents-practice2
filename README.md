# react-stateevents-hw

- You have an api of Beyonce images that have a key of "favorite" which defaults to false
- Your Beyonce images are held in state in the BeyContainer component
- Render a list of all Beyonce images
- When a User clicks on a Beyonce image it should change the "favorite" key true (if it was set to false) or false (if it was set to true)

# What are we practicing?

- changing state of a parent component
- passing a callback function as a prop to be used by a child component
- manipulating objects inside of arrays in state
- rendering a component from multiple parents
- lifting state

### Hint

- To solve this project you may need to do some refactoring
